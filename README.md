# IOT1026-Project

Embark on an epic adventure in this captivating game where danger lurks within the depths of three distinct rooms. The first room conceals a mysterious chest, waiting to be unlocked by the brave hero. Inside lies a precious shield, a vital tool for protection against the perils that lie ahead.

Venture into the second room, a treacherous pit where uncertainty reigns. Here, the room's behavior fluctuates unpredictably, sometimes leading to the hero's demise, while other times rearranging the very fabric of the room itself. Adaptability and quick thinking are essential to survive this enigmatic realm.

The final room holds the key to victory: the coveted sword. Seize this weapon swiftly, for it holds the power to vanquish all obstacles and secure triumph. However, time is of the essence, as the monsters draw closer with every passing moment.

Beware the malevolent Minotaur, a fearsome adversary capable of altering the course of the game. Its deadly presence poses a constant threat, both in the form of potential demise for the hero and the ability to reshape the layout of all the rooms. The tides of fate are in flux, and the hero must navigate wisely to overcome this formidable foe.

But the challenges do not end there. The Gelatinous Cube, a creature attuned to the hero's every movement, adds an extra layer of complexity. With each step taken by the hero, the Gelatinous Cube adapts, shifting its position in an elusive dance. Capturing this elusive entity becomes a daunting task, requiring unwavering focus and strategic prowess.

Prepare yourself for an extraordinary journey filled with twists, surprises, and strategic choices. Can you outwit the Minotaur, outmaneuver the Gelatinous Cube, retrieve the sword, and escape with your life? Only the bravest heroes will triumph in this enthralling game of chance, strategy, and survival.

# Chest Room

 In the realm of the game, the hero embarks on a treacherous journey, encountering various challenges along the way. In one particular room, a mysterious chest beckons, offering potential rewards. The hero stands at a crossroads, contemplating whether to seize the chest or refrain from doing so. However, the game's mechanics dictate that if the hero decides against taking the chest, the opportunity to acquire a valuable shield is forever lost. The chest remains tightly shut until the hero musters the courage to claim it. Once the hero opens the chest, a pivotal moment unfolds as they reveal its contentsâ€”a powerful sword capable of vanquishing the fearsome Minotaur. Equipped with this newfound weapon, the hero is poised to confront the Minotaur and unleash its full potential, heralding a significant advantage in the battle that lies ahead.
