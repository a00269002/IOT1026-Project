Write a description of your `Room` and `Monster` class here.

Chest Room
In the realm of the game, the hero embarks on a treacherous journey, encountering various challenges along the way. In one particular room, a mysterious chest beckons, offering potential rewards. The hero stands at a crossroads, contemplating whether to seize the chest or refrain from doing so. However, the game's mechanics dictate that if the hero decides against taking the chest, the opportunity to acquire a valuable shield is forever lost. The chest remains tightly shut until the hero musters the courage to claim it. Once the hero acquires the chest, a pivotal moment unfolds as they unlock its contents, revealing a powerful sword capable of vanquishing the fearsome Minotaur. Equipped with this newfound weapon, the hero is poised to confront the Minotaur and unleash its full potential, heralding a significant advantage in the battle that lies ahead.
